## Endurance Is Not About Pushing Harder

I didn’t start running to become fast.

<br />

I started running because it was simple: put on shoes, go outside, move forward. Over time, _long-distance running_ stopped being just training and became a way of thinking — about **effort**, **limits**, **recovery**, and what actually holds up when time is the main constraint.

Endurance running teaches lessons that don’t show up in short efforts. You don’t learn them in intervals or race-day adrenaline. You learn them on ordinary days, at unspectacular paces, when no one is watching.

<br />
**_Consistency Beats Intensity:_** Early on, my instinct was the same as in software:
_push harder_, _optimize faster_, _do more_.

That approach works briefly. Then something breaks. In running, it's usually the body: _injuries_, _fatigue_, _burnout_. In systems, it's often something quieter: _growing operational complexity_, _hidden coupling_, _alerts that slowly become noise_.

<br />

Long-distance running rewards showing up slightly tired but still capable. The real gains come from **weeks and months of adequate effort** stacked on top of each other. Not heroic sessions. Not perfect plans. Just **consistency**. And once I accepted that, training became calmer — and _paradoxically, progress accelerated._

### Pace Is a Constraint, Not a Goal

Most _endurance training_ happens slower than ego would prefer. _Easy pace_ feels almost wrong at first. You question whether it's "doing anything." But that restraint is the point. Running too fast too often gives immediate feedback and long-term penalties. Running easy builds capacity quietly.

<br />
This maps directly to **systems design**. Operating close to theoretical limits might look efficient on paper, but it leaves no room for variance: **traffic spikes**, **GC pauses**, **human error**, **bad days**. _Endurance_ — in running or software — comes from **respecting margins**.

So I would argue that sustainable pace is not laziness. It's **engineering**.

### Recovery Is Part of the System

_Recovery_ used to feel like cheating. Skipping a run felt like falling behind. Taking rest days felt unproductive. But _endurance_ doesn't care about intentions — only **outcomes**. Without recovery, effort compounds into damage instead of adaptation.

Over time, I learned to treat **recovery as a first-class input**, not an afterthought. _Sleep_, _nutrition_, and _rest_ aren't "nice to have"; they're what allow stress to turn into progress. The same applies to **technical systems and teams**. _Maintenance windows_, _refactoring_, _observability_, and _slack_ aren't inefficiencies — they're what prevent collapse under load. A system that never rests eventually fails.

### Long Runs Change How You Think

_The long run_ is where most of this becomes obvious. There's no hiding during a two-hour run. You feel every shortcut you took earlier in the week. You learn **patience**, **pacing**, and **restraint** — not through theory, but through _consequence_. Mentally, long runs **strip things down**. Thoughts slow. Problems untangle themselves. You stop trying to optimize every minute and start focusing on **simply continuing**.

That mindset carries over. I'm less interested now in _perfect architectures_ or _maximal performance_. I care more about **what survives contact with reality** — over time, under load, with imperfect inputs.

### Why This Blog Starts Here

This blog is called **Unoptimized** because _endurance_ has convinced me that **optimization**, when taken too far, is often the wrong goal.

Whether it's running, software, or life, **pushing everything to the limit** is rarely sustainable. The systems that last are the ones built with **margin**, **humility**, and **respect for recovery**.

Some posts here will be **technical**. Others **reflective**. Many will sit somewhere **in between**. But they'll all come back to the same question: **_What actually holds up over time?_** 🤔
